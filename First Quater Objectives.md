3.  In-line with our values and secures a positive future settlement on the Moon that includes MoonDAO members.
    
4.  A DAO is uniquely positioned to challenge the challenge.
    
5.  Achievable in the next 1-2 years.
    
6.  Costs no more than 10 million.
    

7.  Find one space engineering firm that is willing to outsource some of their tasks to create a bounty on our DeWork page as a pilot for a revenue stream in the DAO. (Pablo)
    

1.  Task 4.1: Find at least one partner that is mission aligned with MoonDAO and is willing to have MoonDAO’s guild to complete a bounty for them. (Pablo Lead)
    
2.  Task 4.2: Manage the logistical, operations, and legal around matching that task with guild members and the right revenue split between the member and the company. (Pablo Lead)
